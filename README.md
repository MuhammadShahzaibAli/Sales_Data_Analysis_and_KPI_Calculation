# Sales_Data_Analysis_and_KPI_Calculation
The "Profitability Analysis for Purchases" project is a data analysis project aimed at calculating and visualizing the profitability of purchases using SQL. By creating a fact table and leveraging SQL queries, this project provides valuable insights into the financial performance of each purchase, enabling decision making and cost management.

Key Features:

1. Fact Table Creation: Utilizing SQL, a comprehensive fact table is constructed to capture essential data points related to purchases, including costs, revenues, and profit margins.
2. KPI Calculation and Visualization: Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as country-wise margins, average order size, value, volume, and monthly cumulative worldwide margin are calculated using SQL queries. These KPIs are then visualized through charts and graphs to facilitate better understanding and interpretation.
3. Insights and Decision Support: The project offers insightful analysis on the profitability of specific purchases, venues, and items. These insights help guide decision-making processes, optimize cost of sales, and improve overall gross margin management.

This project serves as a valuable tool for businesses seeking to gain a deeper understanding of their purchase profitability, identify areas for improvement, and make data-driven decisions to enhance financial performance.
